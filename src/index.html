Turkman Linux is a independent GNU/Linux distribution. It uses its own YMP (Yerli ve Milli Package) manager. Turkman Linux is a distribution originating from Turkiye. ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡· The reason for its development is to create an independent distribution using new generation technologies and to provide ease of use.<br>
